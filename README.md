# Hobby Tracker

A personal website to help track hobbies, the items needed for each hobby, and their associated costs.

- **Item Management**: For each hobby, track the items needed, their prices, priorities, and acquisition status.
- **Cost Breakdown**: See a visual breakdown of the total cost of items needed for each hobby using pie charts.
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark items as "acquired" and see how many items are still pending.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-responsive design that looks great on any device.
